# OKR Manager: Feature Completion & Remediation Report

**Last updated:** 2025-06-26

## âœ… Completed

- **Roles & Access Control**
  - Normalized roles (Role table, migrated User model, added isAdmin/isLineManager/roleName fields)
  - Refactored registration, login, and session logic to use new role fields
  - Updated all access checks and API endpoints to use new role/session fields
  - Removed all legacy role string checks and dropped User.role column

- **UI/UX Modernization**
  - Fixed SSR/hydration issues in Joy UI and navigation
  - Modernized and unified UI for login, registration, dashboard, and review flows
  - Fixed layout issues (centering, max width, etc.)

- **Quarterly Review & Key Results**
  - Fixed quarterly review form to clear state when switching quarters/years
  - Refactored ObjectiveKeyResultsClient to use roleName and correct role checks for editing success criteria
  - Fixed typos and variable usage in key result progress and comments fields
  - Centered and constrained objective page card to max 90vw

- **API & Backend**
  - Added robust input validation (zod) and rate limiting (next-rate-limit) to all API endpoints
  - Fixed all API route handler signatures for Next.js (removed `{ params }`, extracted IDs from URLs)
  - Removed all `: any` from catch blocks and backend API route files
  - Fixed build-blocking issues related to API route signatures and missing dependencies
  - Systematically removed unused variables/imports, replaced `any` with specific types or `unknown`, and fixed JSX quote issues in all major frontend and backend files
  - Updated test files to use ES imports and proper `@ts-expect-error` usage
  - Refactored `ObjectiveKeyResultsClient.tsx` and `quarterly-reviews/page.tsx` to use proper interfaces for all state and mapping logic
  - Added CORS headers and OPTIONS handlers to all major API routes using a shared utility (Next.js best practice)

- **Build & Lint**
  - Iteratively ran `npm run build` to check for and resolve all errors
  - All TypeScript/ESLint errors resolved; build passes cleanly
  - Fixed Next.js suspense boundary issue for `useSearchParams`

- **Documentation & Review**
  - Updated FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md to reflect all new features and improvements
  - Generated a comprehensive code review report (CodeReview_OKR_Manager_2025-06-26.md) per SAR template

## ðŸŸ¡ In Progress / Next Steps

- (From Next_Features.md) Implement new features:
  - Move line manager features out of admin
  - Add line manager links to user home
  - User profile editing and token generation
  - Gov Notify integration
