# Collaboration Tips for Working with GitHub Copilot

Here are some ways to make our time together as efficient and productive as possible:

1. **Batch Requests**
   - If you have several related changes or questions, list them together. This allows me to plan and execute multiple steps in one go.

2. **Context Up Front**
   - If you’re working on a specific feature or bug, a quick summary of the goal and any constraints helps me give more targeted advice and avoid unnecessary clarifications.

3. **Share Error Output**
   - When you hit a build, lint, or runtime error, paste the full error message or output. This lets me diagnose and fix issues faster.

4. **Highlight Priorities**
   - If some tasks are urgent or blocking, let me know which to focus on first.

5. **Keep Docs/Specs Updated**
   - If you update requirements, feature lists, or architecture docs, let me know so I can align my suggestions and code with the latest direction.

6. **Let Me Automate**
   - If you want, I can automate repetitive tasks (like updating headers, fixing types, or refactoring patterns) across your codebase in one sweep.

7. **Feedback Loop**
   - If my output isn’t quite what you want, a quick note on what to change (style, depth, format) helps me adapt quickly.
