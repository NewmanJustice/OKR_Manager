# Security Review Report: OKR_Manager

**Review Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Repository:** OKR_Manager  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot  
**Application Type:** Full-Stack Web Application (Next.js, Prisma, SQLite)

## Executive Security Summary

The OKR_Manager codebase demonstrates a strong foundation in authentication, role-based access, and session management. However, several areas require attention to ensure production-grade security, especially before public cloud deployment.

### Key Security Strengths

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Use of normalized Role table and isAdmin/isLineManager flags.
- **Password Handling:** Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
- **Session Management:** Secure session cookies with secrets.
- **Email Verification:** Users must verify email before login.
- **hCaptcha Integration:** Protects registration, login, and password reset flows.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implemented on sensitive API endpoints.

### High/Medium Priority Security Issues

| Issue | Severity | Impact | Location | Recommendation |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Input Validation** | High | Injection, malformed data | Some API endpoints | Ensure all endpoints use strict validation (zod or similar) |
| **CORS Configuration** | High | Cross-origin attacks | API/server config | Explicitly set CORS policy for allowed origins |
| **Dependency Scanning** | Medium | Vulnerable packages | General | Use `npm audit` or Snyk in CI/CD |
| **Security Headers** | Medium | XSS, clickjacking | Server responses | Add headers: `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Content-Security-Policy` |
| **HTTPS Enforcement** | Medium | Data interception | App Service config | Force HTTPS in Azure settings and app logic |
| **Logging Sensitive Data** | Medium | Data leakage | Console logs, error messages | Remove all console/debug logs before deployment |
| **No MFA** | Medium | Account takeover | Auth flows | Consider adding optional MFA for admins |
| **No Audit Logging** | Medium | Incident response | API/server | Add audit logs for critical actions (optional) |
| **No Automated Security Testing** | Medium | Missed vulnerabilities | CI/CD | Add security tests to pipeline |
| **No Brute-force/MFA lockout** | Medium | Account brute-forcing | Auth flows | Consider lockout or MFA after repeated failures |

### Additional Notes

- **Environment Variables:** Ensure all secrets (DB, JWT, hCaptcha, email) are set via Azure App Service configuration, not hardcoded.
- **Database:** Use managed Azure DB for production, not SQLite.
- **File Uploads:** If present, validate and scan all uploads.
- **Dependency Updates:** Regularly update dependencies.

## OWASP Top 10 Compliance

- **A01 Broken Access Control:** Good use of session and role checks, but some endpoints lack explicit validation
- **A02 Cryptographic Failures:** Session cookies use a secret, but no HTTPS enforcement in dev
- **A03 Injection:** Prisma ORM mitigates SQL injection, but lack of input validation is a risk
- **A04 Insecure Design:** Role-based access is robust, but no rate limiting or audit logging
- **A05 Security Misconfiguration:** No explicit CORS or security headers
- **A06 Vulnerable Components:** No automated dependency scanning
- **A07 Authentication Failures:** Session management is robust, but no MFA or brute-force protection
- **A08 Software Integrity Failures:** No supply chain validation
- **A09 Logging Failures:** No security monitoring or incident response hooks
- **A10 SSRF:** Not applicable (no external fetches from user input)

## Recommendations and Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Critical/High Priority)
- [x] Add input validation and sanitization to all API endpoints (**Completed: June 26, 2025**)
- [ ] Remove all console logging and debugging statements from backend and frontend
- [ ] Implement automated unit and integration tests for all business logic and API routes
- [x] Add rate limiting and DoS protection to API endpoints (**Completed: June 26, 2025**)

### Short-term Improvements (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all APIs
- [ ] Implement CORS configuration and security headers
- [ ] Add pagination to all endpoints returning lists
- [ ] Set up dependency vulnerability scanning (e.g., npm audit, Snyk)

### Long-term Enhancements (Low Priority)
- [ ] Add inline code documentation and architecture diagrams
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Consider dependency injection for improved testability
